# pi-pstack

A pi-mimir fork of [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack). It keeps all upstream skills that are platform-portable (46; `make-bot-ui` is Cursor-platform-only and excluded), the sticky Poteto Mode, and the bundled `poteto-agent` and `comment-sicko` agents — but it delegates through [pi-herdr-agents](https://github.com/giuseppecrj/pi-herdr-agents) instead of shipping its own `subagent` tool.

## Why this fork exists

Upstream pi-pstack registers a tool named `subagent`. pi-herdr-agents registers a tool with the same name. Loading both made one shadow the other. This fork drops the `subagent` tool registration entirely so pi-herdr-agents' `subagent` is the only one, and pstack's bundled agents become inputs to it.

## How delegation works here

pi-herdr-agents resolves roles from bundled, role-pack, global, and project definitions. This extension publishes its bundled `agents/` directory as a role pack, registering it on the `pi-herdr-subagents:roles:discover:v1` event when the extension loads. The host reads and validates the definitions in place, so nothing is copied into `~/.pi/agent/agents`.

After install, check the roles with `subagents_list` and delegate the pi-herdr-agents way:

```text
subagent({ name: "Fix retry regression", agent: "poteto-agent", task: "investigate and fix the retry regression, then verify it" })
```

`poteto-agent` self-instructs to read the bundled `poteto-mode` skill in full before working, so the behavior upstream got via prompt injection is preserved without this fork injecting anything.

## What's included

- 46 skills under `skills/`, matching the upstream inventory minus Cursor-only `make-bot-ui` (prose adapted where Pi differs).
- `poteto-agent` and `comment-sicko` agent definitions under `agents/`, published to pi-herdr-agents as a role pack.
- Commands: `/poteto-mode` (sticky Poteto Mode for the session).
- Tools: none. Task tracking, session recall, and subagent model routing use the host environment (`set_tasks` family, `recall`, `subagents_write_task_models`).

## What's removed vs upstream

- The `subagent` tool and its child-Pi process runner. Use pi-herdr-agents' `subagent` instead.
- `/setup-pstack`, `pstack_config`, `pstack_todo`, `pstack_sessions`, and the `~/.pi/agent/pstack/models.json` role map. The live role-to-model routing is pi-herdr-agents' `models.tasks`/`models.agents` config (`subagents_write_task_models`). Workflow skills consult that config for the per-call `model` they pass to `subagent`. Panel roles take model lists; set those via `models.agents` per agent or `task:<category>` routing.

## Safety

By default, the extension requests confirmation for recognizable Bash commands that push, alter pull requests, merge, deploy, mutate infrastructure, or recursively delete files. It blocks these commands when no UI is available. This is a guardrail, not a complete shell-security sandbox.

To restore upstream pstack autonomy and disable the command check, set `confirmExternalActions` to `false` in `~/.pi/agent/pstack/config.json`:

```json
{"confirmExternalActions": false}
```

If `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set, use `<PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR>/pstack/config.json` instead. Restart Pi or reload the extension after a config change. Poteto Mode reads this setting to choose its autonomy instructions. With `false`, external actions proceed without asking; irreversible writes still require a pause. Missing, malformed, or other values keep the check and confirmation instructions enabled.
